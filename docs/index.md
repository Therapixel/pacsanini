# Welcome to pacsanini

`pacsanini` is a package designed to help with the collection of DICOM files
and the extraction of DICOM tags (metadata) for structuring purposes.

### Overview

`pacsanini`'s functionalities come out of a desire to facilitate research in
medical imagery by easing the process of data collection and structuring.

The two main pain points for this are:

* acquiring data from a PACS
* extracting metadata from DICOM files in research-ready formats (eg: csv)
