# Welcome to pacsanini

`pacsanini` ðŸŽ» is a package designed to help with the collection of DICOM files and the extraction
of DICOM tags (metadata) for structuring purposes.

`pacsanini`'s functionalities come out of a desire to facilitate research in
medical imagery by easing the process of data collection and structuring.
The two main pain points for this are:

* acquiring data from a PACS
* extracting metadata from DICOM files in research-ready formats (eg: csv)
* visualize collected DICOM data

The project seeks to target medical/research professionals that are not necessarily
familiar with coding but wish to obtain data sets and software engineers that wish to
build applications with a certain level of abstraction.
