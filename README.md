# pacsanini

`pacsanini` ðŸŽ» is a package designed to help with the collection of DICOM files and the extraction of DICOM tags (metadata) for structuring purposes.

`pacsanini`'s functionalities come out of a desire to facilitate research in
medical imagery by easing the process of data collection and structuring.

The two main pain points for this are:

* acquiring data from a PACS
* extracting metadata from DICOM files in research-ready formats (eg: csv)

## Roadmap

### Data Collection

* ðŸš§ Make single-command pipeline more mature.
  * Add a feature to send notifications when a step is done

* ðŸš§ Use sql storage as an alternative to CSV storage.

### Testing

ðŸš§ Find a good way to test DICOM network messaging applications. Possibly with the
`dcmtk` suite, the apps from `pynetdicom` or even a Docker container with a PACS?
